## Description

BlogApp is a platform that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Users can also comment on posts and engage in discussions. This app was built to provide a simple and intuitive way for people to share their thoughts and interact with each other online. Our group built this app to practice our skills in full-stack development, focusing on creating a seamless user experience.
